## Prerequisites {#prerequisites.wp-block-heading}

Before we get started, there are a few prerequisites that you&#8217;ll need:

  * A WordPress website with Elementor page builder installed and activated.
  * The ElementsKit Elementor addon installed and activated on your WordPress website.

Once you have these prerequisites, you&#8217;re ready to get started!

## Benefits of Using ElementsKit Widget Builder {#benefits-of-using-elements-kit-widget-builder.wp-block-heading}

The ElementsKit widget builder makes creating custom widgets for Elementor simple and efficient. Here are some benefits of using the ElementsKit widget builder:

  * Creating custom widgets that are completely responsive
  * Supporting structured content
  * Including a standalone code editor
  * Supporting multiple field types

## Step-by-Step Guide {#step-by-step-guide.wp-block-heading}

Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide on how to create a custom Elementor widget using the ElementsKit widget builder:

### Step 1: Turn on the Widget Builder {#step-1-turn-on-the-widget-builder.wp-block-heading}

To start building your custom Elementor widget, you&#8217;ll need to turn on the Widget Builder module from the ElementsKit dashboard panel. Here&#8217;s how to do it:

  1. Log in to your WordPress website and go to the ElementsKit dashboard panel.
  2. Click on &#8220;Modules&#8221; from the left-hand menu.
  3. Locate the &#8220;Widget Builder&#8221; module and turn it on.
  4. Be sure to click the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button.

### Step 2: Create a New Widget {#step-2-create-a-new-widget.wp-block-heading}

Now that you&#8217;ve turned on the Widget Builder module, it&#8217;s time to create a new widget. Here&#8217;s how:

  1. Go to ElementsKit > Widget Builder.
  2. Click on the &#8220;Add New&#8221; button to create a new widget for your Elementor left panel.
  3. Customize the widget title, icon, and category as desired. You can use any icon from the Font Awesome icon library.

### Step 3: Customize the New Widget {#step-3-customize-the-new-widget.wp-block-heading}

You don&#8217;t need any coding knowledge to customize the new widget. The ElementsKit widget builder allows you to drag and drop elements from the left panel onto the middle panel to create your custom widget. Here&#8217;s how:

  1. Drag ElementsKit controls from the left panel and drop them onto the middle panel.
  2. The dropped controls will automatically create a variable on the right board.
  3. Click on the variable to include it in the code editor.
  4. If you need to add additional HTML, CSS, or JavaScript markup, you can do so via the code editor.
  5. Once you&#8217;ve built your new widget, click the &#8220;Save&#8221; button to save your changes.

### Step 4: Modify the Widget Fields {#step-4-modify-the-widget-fields.wp-block-heading}

While developing the widget, you can customize all of the widget fields. For example, you can customize the label name, placeholder, default value, etc. Here&#8217;s how:

  1. Modify the fields as needed.
  2. Be sure to keep the name of each control unique to avoid variable conflicts.

### Step 5: Preview the Newly Built Widget {#step-5-preview-the-newly-built-widget.wp-block-heading}

The newly built widget works just like the existing Elementor widgets. To check the new widget, open a new webpage and drag and drop the widget onto the new webpage.

## Supported Control Fields {#supported-control-fields.wp-block-heading}
