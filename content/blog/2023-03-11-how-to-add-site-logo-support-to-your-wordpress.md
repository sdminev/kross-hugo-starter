## Adding logo support to a WordPress theme is a simple task that can be accomplished in a few steps. {.wp-block-heading}

In this article, we will cover how to add logo support to your WordPress theme, including code examples and the most recent keywords.

**Step 1:** 

Add Support for Custom Logos in Your Theme To add logo support to your theme, you will need to add code to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file. This code will tell WordPress that your theme supports custom logos. You can use the following code to add logo support to your theme:

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// Add support for custom logo
function themename_setup() {
    add_theme_support( 'custom-logo', array(
        'height'      =&gt; 100,
        'width'       =&gt; 400,
        'flex-width'  =&gt; true,
        'flex-height' =&gt; true,
    ) );
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_setup' );
</code></pre>

In the above code, replace &#8220;themename&#8221; with the name of your theme.

The add\_theme\_support function adds support for custom logos, and the array specifies the logo&#8217;s height, width, and flexibility. With this code, you will now be able to upload a logo in the WordPress Customizer.

Step 2: Display the Logo in Your Theme Once you have added support for custom logos, you will need to display the logo in your theme. You can do this by adding the following code to your theme&#8217;s header.php file:

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;?php if ( has_custom_logo() ) : ?&gt;
    &lt;div class="site-logo"&gt;&lt;?php the_custom_logo(); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt; 

</code></pre>

This code checks if a custom logo has been uploaded and displays it in a div with a class of &#8220;site-logo&#8221;. If no custom logo has been uploaded, nothing will be displayed.

**Step 3:** 

Style the Logo in Your Theme To style the logo in your theme, you can use CSS. For example, you might want to center the logo and adjust its size. You can use the following CSS code to do this:

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>.site-logo {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

.site-logo img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
</code></pre>

In the above code, we use flexbox to center the logo and set the maximum width of the image to 100%. This ensures that the logo will be responsive and adjust to the size of the user&#8217;s screen.

**Conclusion** 

Adding logo support to your WordPress theme is a simple process that can be accomplished with just a few lines of code. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can add custom logo support to your theme and display it in a way that complements your design.
