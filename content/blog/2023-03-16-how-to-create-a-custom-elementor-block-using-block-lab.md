  5. Preview your block to make sure it looks and works the way you want it to.
  6. Save your block and give it a name.

## Step 3: Export the Block as a Plugin {.wp-block-heading}

Once you&#8217;ve created your custom block in Block Lab, you need to export it as a plugin so that you can use it on your website. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. Go to the &#8220;Block Lab&#8221; section of your WordPress dashboard.
  2. Click on the &#8220;Export&#8221; button next to your block.
  3. Choose &#8220;Plugin&#8221; as the export format.
  4. Enter a name for your plugin and click &#8220;Export&#8221;.
  5. Save the plugin file to your computer.

## Step 4: Install and Activate the Plugin {.wp-block-heading}

Now that you&#8217;ve exported your custom block as a plugin, you need to install and activate it on your website. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. Go to the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; section of your WordPress dashboard.
  2. Click on &#8220;Add New&#8221; and then &#8220;Upload Plugin&#8221;.
  3. Choose the plugin file you saved in the previous step and click &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.
  4. Click &#8220;Activate Plugin&#8221; to activate the plugin.

## Step 5: Add the Block to Elementor {.wp-block-heading}

Once you&#8217;ve created your custom Elementor block using Block Lab, you&#8217;ll need to add it to Elementor so that you can use it on your website. There are two ways to do this:

### Using a shortcode {.wp-block-heading}

After you have created your custom block, you can add it to any page or post using a shortcode. Here&#8217;s how to do it:

  1. Copy the shortcode for your custom block from the Block Lab plugin. You can find the shortcode by going to the &#8220;Blocks&#8221; menu in the WordPress dashboard and clicking on your custom block.
  2. Open the Elementor editor for the page or post where you want to add your block.
  3. Add a new &#8220;Shortcode&#8221; widget to the page by dragging the widget from the Elementor sidebar onto the page.
  4. Paste the shortcode into the &#8220;Shortcode&#8221; widget.
  5. Save your changes and preview the page to see your custom block in action.

Using shortcodes is a quick and easy way to add your custom block to any page or post on your website. However, if you want more control over the placement and styling of your block, you can add it to Elementor as a widget instead.  
  


### Adding the block as a widget {.wp-block-heading}

If you want to add your custom block to Elementor as a widget, you can use the &#8220;Custom HTML&#8221; widget. Here&#8217;s how to do it:

  1. Open the Elementor editor for the page or post where you want to add your block.
  2. Click on the &#8220;+&#8221; icon in the Elementor editor to add a new widget or section.
  3. Search for the &#8220;Custom HTML&#8221; widget and drag it onto the page where you want your block to appear.
  4. Click on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button in the widget to open the HTML editor.
  5. Copy the HTML code for your custom block from the Block Lab plugin.
  6. Paste the HTML code into the HTML editor of the &#8220;Custom HTML&#8221; widget.
  7. Click &#8220;Apply&#8221; to save your changes.

Your custom block will now appear in the Elementor editor as a widget, and you can add it to any page or post using the drag-and-drop interface.
