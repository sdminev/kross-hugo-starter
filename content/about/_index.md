## I will find and fix you!

I've been in IT as long as I can remember - say, since High School. Before that I know about me only from word of mouth :)

Creating stuff - and fixing more stuff, has been my passion ever since I dismantled my Nintendo64; Seriously, in the 90s, if you broke your console, you didn't simply get a new one. So I had to put it back together. I tried hard. And I couldn't :/ 

Many years later, I believe that's what set me on the path I'm right now - driven by endless curiosity, strive for perfecting everything and a healthy dose of creativity.
